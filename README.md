# Searching and sorting
1. we create RecordsOfStudent.txt to store Students data.
2. we use two.cs files. 

   2.1 we create program.cs file to call the Do() which perform all the operations.
  
   2.2 we create Record.cs file to implement Do() which read data from the file and perform searching based on the key value entered by the user and sort the values.
